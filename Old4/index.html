            <h1>LowPy</h1>
            <h2>A High-Level Simulator of Neuromorphic ML Processor Non-Idealities</h2>
            <img  id="lowpy" src="lowpy.svg">
            <p>The field of <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/neuromorphic-computing.html">Neuromorphic Computing</a> aims to develop ASIC, hardware-style implementations of machine learning algorithms, among other things. Often, this is accomplished with novel devices, like the memristors pictured above. While these memristors make excellent candidates for storing neural network weights, and even conducting in-memory computing operations, they have their own "side effects", such as write variability, drift, decay, limited precision, and more non-ideal characteristics which can cause weights to behave unexpectedly. The question then becomes: <strong>How can one determine if a novel device is suitable for hardware implementation of a particular machine learning algorithm?</strong> That's where LowPy comes in.</p>
            <p>LowPy is a GPU-accelerateable Python machine learning package which wraps a non-ideal simulator around a <a href="https://keras.io">Keras</a> model for controlled weight alteration during machine learning fitting, evaluation, and validation.</p>
            <p>To install LowPy, simply run</p> 
            <pre>pip install lowpy</pre>
            <p> in the Terminal/Command prompt of any computer running Python 3. Visit the <a href="">LowPy GitHub page</a> or the <a href="">LowPy documentation page</a> for more information.</p>
